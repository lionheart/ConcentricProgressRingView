## About

**LionheartExtensions** is a handy collection of extensions, helpers, and other utilities that I've collected since the introduction of the iOS SDK, ported to Swift. It started off as a collection of [Objective-C categories](https://github.com/lionheart/LHSCategoryCollection) with roots going years back. These extensions make numerous cumbersome operations easy and straightforward, with improved initializers, helper methods, and other various shortcuts.

LionheartExtensions uses [Semantic Versioning][semver-url].

Please read the [documentation][doc-url] for further information.
